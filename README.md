### Description

The goal of this homework assignment was to create a searchable weather dashboard using server side apis via open weather. A user should be able to search a city and get the current weather plus the five day forecast. Previous searches should display in the sidebar to peruse.

### Strategy

First, I had to get an api key and test all the functionality of pulling data from the API. Most of that data was pretty straightforward, although there were some confusing elements, like pulling the UV index, and figuring out how to format the date and time data for the 5-day-forecast. I struggled with getting the functionality working properly on the local storage end of things, as well as some error handling, but I'm satisfied with the progress I've made so far.
